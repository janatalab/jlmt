Janata Lab Music Toolbox (JLMT)


PREREQUISITES

JLMT requires installation of the IPEM Toolbox. It can be obtained at:
     - http://www.ipem.ugent.be/Toolbox. 

If processing mp3 files, "mp3read" scripts are required. These were
acquired from:
     -  http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/mp3read.html
and included in the JLMT in the 'jlmt/includes' directory, however they
are compiled for use on Linux machines. If you are running Windows, you
may have to update the mp3read scripts. Visit the LabROSA web site for
more information on mp3read.

JLMT also requires installation of the following Matlab Toolboxes:
     - Signal Processing
     - Statistics

The MIDI Toolbox is an optional toolbox that can be used by the
JLMT. For more information on using the MIDI Toolbox with the JLMT,
please read the section below titled 'MIDI FILES and BTB'. The MIDI
Toolbox may be found at:
     - http://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/miditoolbox/


INSTALLATION

1) Install all prerequisites for the JLMT.

2) Unpackage the JLMT distribution file. This will create a directory
named 'jlmt_dist'. Copy the JLMT directory to an appropriate location
for your matlab installation. Add this directory, and all subdirectories 
to your Matlab path. This can be easily accomplished by adding the
following line to your startup.m file:

    path(path,genpath(<path_to_JLMT>));

where <path_to_JLMT> is the absolute path to the JLMT directory. An 
example of lines to add to your startup.m file can be found in:

    jlmt/jlmt_startup.m

Make sure to replace '/home/fbarrett/matlab/jlmt_dist' in that file
with the path to your particular jlmt directory. You may also use the
MATLAB user interface to add JLMT paths by choosing:

    File -> Set Path

then clicking "Add with Subfolders" and selecting your JLMT
directory.

3) Restart Matlab and check your paths with the following command:

    which jlmt_proc_series

If Matlab returns the path to your JLMT installation, then you have
properly set the JLMT path.

4) Run the 'test_jlmt.m' script in the 'test/' subdirectory of your
JLMT installation. If this script runs without error, then your JLMT
installation is complete.


MIDI FILES and BTB

A MIDI file reader written in Java, "Midi2tr.java", and a second
java class, "TrackInfo.java", located in the midi subdirectory must
be compiled and configured for Matlab in order to use BTB with MIDI
files. If you don't have a Java compiler installed on your system,
it can be obtained by downloading the Java Standard Edition (Java SE)
at java.sun.com. The current version at the time of this writing is
JSE 7 Update 4. To compile Midi2tr.java and TrackInfo.java, simply go
to the midi directory and type the following at a command line
(assuming that javac is in your path):

    javac Midi2tr.java TrackInfo.java

This should create files "Midi2tr.class" and "TrackInfo.class" in the
midi directory. In order to use the Java classes in Matlab, the path
of the midi directory (e.g. /home/username/JLMT/midi) must be added
to Matlab's classpath.txt, which typically resides in:

    <path to Matlab application>/toolbox/local

The MIDI reader was written in java to speed up the process of reading
very large MIDI files.  Alternately, you may install the MIDI Toolbox
and replace the line in plot_dir_rhythm_profile.m:

    tr = javamidi2tr(thisLocation);

with the following:

    tr.nmat = readmidi(thisLocation);

The MIDI Toolbox may be obtained from:
