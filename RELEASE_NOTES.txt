----------------------------------------------------
Release v1.3 - March 18, 2013
----------------------------------------------------

- added scripts and data to accompany:

  Tom Collins, Barbara Tillmann, Frederick S. Barrett, Charles Delb√©,
    and Petr Janata. A combined model of sensory and cognitive
    representations underlying tonal expectation: from audio signals
    to behavior. Submitted, 2013.

- minor bug fixes relating to identification of audio files nested
within directories and management of parameters when none or sparse
parameters are specified

----------------------------------------------------
Release v1.2 - October, 2012
----------------------------------------------------

- jlmt_proc_series has been updated to support processing of
individual directories and files without specifying any parameters,
and relying solely on default parameters.

- Default parameter setting and propogation has been re-worked.

- The Neural Network Toolbox is no longer required to project data
from periodicity pitch space or leaky-integrated context space to
pitch class space. This was the only dependency on the NNet Toolbox,
therefore this package is no longer required for any portion of jlmt.

----------------------------------------------------
Release v1.1 - August 22, 2012
----------------------------------------------------

- Bug fix in jlmt_proc_series.m, where multiple proc params were not
being honored for the first step in a proc series.

----------------------------------------------------
Release v1.0 - July 9, 2012
----------------------------------------------------

This is the initial release of the jlmt, including:

- jlmt_proc_series.m

- scripts to facilitate generation of tonality tracking matrices and
  fmri regressors based on those matrices

- the Beyond The Beat (BTB) algorithm developed by Tomic and Janata
